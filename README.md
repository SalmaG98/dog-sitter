*Home installed automatic feeder + Smart Collar*

This git repo contains nothing but testing code for all the hardware (MCUs, sensors, actuators, GSM/GPRS, GPS Modules) that were used during my summer internship as an Embedded Systems Intern at **Orange Developer Center & El Fab Space Lac**.

At the end of this internship we were able to present a fully functioning station and collar for pets.

Station and Collar design on SolidWorks:
